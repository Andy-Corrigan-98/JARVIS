# Architecture Overview

## Technology Stack

The JARVIS website is built using modern web technologies:

- **Next.js 14+**: React framework with server-side rendering capabilities
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **React**: For component-based UI development

## Application Structure

```

├── components/       # Reusable React components
│   ├── ui/          # Basic UI components
│   ├── layout/      # Layout components
│   └── features/    # Feature-specific components
├── styles/          # Global styles and Tailwind configuration
└── lib/            # Shared utilities and helpers
```

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **App Router**: Using Next.js App Router for:
   - Server-side rendering
   - API routes
   - Static site generation where appropriate
   - Optimized image handling

2. **Component Architecture**:
   - Atomic design principles
   - Component composition over inheritance
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable UI components

3. **State Management**:
   - React hooks for local state
   - Server components for data fetching
   - Client components only where necessary

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Static page generation where possible
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Font optimization

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy
- XSS prevention
- CORS configuration
- Input sanitization

## Development Workflow

1. Feature branches for development
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. ESLint for code quality
4. Prettier for code formatting
5. Husky for pre-commit hooks

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for pages
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Accessibility testing

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
- Logging strategy

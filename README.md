# JARVIS

## Overview
JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an open-source personal assistant project inspired by Tony Stark's AI companion from the Marvel universe. The project aims to demonstrate practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a user-friendly web/app interface, with a focus on personalized assistance and dynamic learning.

### Vision
- Create an accessible, open-source personal assistant that helps people manage their daily lives
- Showcase real-world applications of LLM technology in a practical, user-focused way
- Build a system that learns and adapts to each user's needs through personalized data storage
- Foster a community-driven approach to developing AI assistance capabilities

While not attempting to achieve full artificial general intelligence (AGI), JARVIS strives to provide meaningful, personalized assistance by combining:
- Modern LLM capabilities
- User-specific learning and adaptation
- Intuitive interface design
- Privacy-focused personal data management

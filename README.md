# JARVIS

## Overview
JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an open-source personal assistant project inspired by Tony Stark's AI companion from the Marvel universe. The project aims to demonstrate practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a user-friendly web/app interface, with a focus on personalized assistance and dynamic learning.

### Vision
Our vision for JARVIS encompasses several key areas:

#### Core Principles
- Create an accessible, open-source personal assistant that helps people manage their daily lives
- Foster a community-driven approach to developing AI assistance capabilities
- Build a system that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime
- Promote understanding and appreciation of LLM capabilities and limitations

#### Accessibility & Inclusion
JARVIS aims to enhance independence and quality of life for people with various needs:

**For People with Disabilities:**
- Enable control of devices and appliances for increased independence
- Facilitate communication for non-verbal individuals
- Foster more open dialogue and understanding between users and their communities

**For Neurodiverse Individuals:**
- Provide support for those who experience the need to "mask" in social situations
- Allow users to express themselves more openly and honestly
- Act as an optional interface between users and their environment when needed
- Help users maintain their authentic selves while navigating social situations

#### Personal Growth & Support
JARVIS is designed to be:
- A supportive tool, not a replacement for human interaction
- An aid in decision-making, not a decision maker
- An accountability partner for personal goals and aspirations
- A bridge between isolation and connection in our modern world

#### Privacy & Security
- Privacy-focused personal data management
- User-specific learning and adaptation
- Transparent, open-source development
- Community-driven security measures

#### Development Philosophy
While JARVIS does not aim to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), we prioritize:
- Responsible development with built-in security guardrails
- Open-source collaboration for safety and transparency
- Community oversight and contribution
- Continuous learning and improvement

My commitment is to develop JARVIS as a force for good, with security and privacy fundamentals built in from the start. Being open-source allows the GitHub community to ensure JARVIS develops safely and securely, benefiting from collective expertise and oversight.

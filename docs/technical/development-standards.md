# Development Standards

This document outlines the development standards and principles followed in this project.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (S)
- Each class/module should have one reason to change
- Keep files focused and specific in purpose
- Examples:
  - Separate data access from business logic
  - Split complex classes into focused components

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (O)
- Code should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Use interfaces and abstract classes where appropriate
- Examples:
  - Use strategy pattern for varying behaviors
  - Implement plugins via interfaces

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (L)
- Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- Maintain consistent interfaces
- Examples:
  - Ensure inherited methods maintain base class contracts
  - Don't strengthen preconditions in derived classes

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (I)
- Keep interfaces small and focused
- Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- Examples:
  - Split large interfaces into smaller ones
  - Create role-specific interfaces

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (D)
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Examples:
  - Use interface-based design
  - Implement IoC containers where beneficial

## Code Organization

### File Structure
- One primary class per file
- Group related files in meaningful directories
- Keep directory depth reasonable (max 3-4 levels)
- Use clear, descriptive file names

### Code Style
- Follow consistent indentation (spaces preferred)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include JSDoc/similar documentation for public APIs

## Best Practices

### General
- Keep It Simple (KISS principle)
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Write testable code
- Handle errors appropriately

### Performance
- Consider memory usage
- Optimize critical paths
- Use appropriate data structures
- Cache when beneficial

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize all outputs
- Follow security best practices
- Keep dependencies updated

## Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Keep documentation up to date
- Document breaking changes
- Update changelog for notable changes

## Testing
- Write unit tests for new features
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Maintain test coverage
- Test edge cases
- Write readable test cases

```

#### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

#### Scope
The scope should be the area of the codebase affected (e.g., docs, core, api)

#### Subject
- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Keep it under 50 characters

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Proposing New Features ðŸ’¡
Have an idea? Here's how to propose it:
1. Open an issue with the "feature proposal" template
2. Include:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Expected benefits
   - Potential challenges
3. Engage in discussion with maintainers and community
4. Refine the proposal based on feedback

### 2. Feature Approval Process
When your idea gains traction:
1. A maintainer will review the proposal
2. If approved:
   - A feature file is created from the template
   - File is placed in `docs/changelog/features/backlog/`
   - The issue is linked to the feature file
3. The feature is now ready for development

### 3. Development Workflow
When working on a feature:
1. **Starting Development**:
   - Move feature file from `backlog/` to `in-progress/`
   - Update the feature's status and timeline
   - Create feature branch from main

2. **During Development**:
   - Keep feature file updated with progress
   - Link related PRs and issues
   - Update technical requirements as needed

3. **Completing Development**:
   - Ensure all success criteria are met
   - Update documentation
   - Submit final PR for review
   - Feature file moves to `done/` after release

### 4. Documentation Requirements
Each feature should maintain:
- Updated feature file with current status
- Technical documentation in `docs/technical/`
- Updated user documentation if applicable
- Migration guides for breaking changes

## Making Changes

### Small Changes
For bug fixes or minor improvements:
1. Create an issue describing the problem
2. Submit a PR with the fix
3. Add entry to next release notes if applicable

### Major Changes
For significant changes:
1. Follow the feature development process
2. Break work into manageable PRs
3. Keep feature file updated with progress
4. Ensure comprehensive documentation

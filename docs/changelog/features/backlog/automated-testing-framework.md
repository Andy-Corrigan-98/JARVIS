# Feature: Automated Testing Framework

## Overview
Establish a comprehensive automated testing framework to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Status
Current status: Backlog
Target Release: 1.0.0

## Details
### Problem Statement
The project needs a reliable way to verify code functionality, prevent regressions, and maintain quality standards as it grows.

### Proposed Solution
Implement a multi-level testing framework including:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
- Code coverage reporting

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Unit testing framework implemented
- [ ] Integration testing framework implemented
- [ ] End-to-end testing capability added
- [ ] Code coverage reporting set up
- [ ] Documentation for writing and running tests
- [ ] CI integration for automated test runs

## Implementation
### Technical Requirements
- Test runner and assertion library
- Mocking framework
- Code coverage tool
- CI-compatible configuration
- Documentation generator

### Dependencies
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Build process configuration
- Code coverage minimum thresholds agreement

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Test maintenance overhead | Medium | Focus on critical paths, use test generators where appropriate |
| False positives | High | Implement robust test patterns, regular test review |
| Performance impact | Medium | Optimize test runs, parallel execution |

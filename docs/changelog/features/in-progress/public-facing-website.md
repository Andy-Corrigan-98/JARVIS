# Feature: Public-Facing Website

## Overview
Create a simple, modern public-facing website using React to showcase the JARVIS project, its vision, and core principles. The initial implementation will focus on a local development environment to allow developers to preview and contribute to the website.

## Status
Current status: In Progress
Target Release: 1.0.0

### State Changes
- Proposed: 2025-02-08
- Approved: 2025-02-08
- Started: 2025-02-08
- Completed/Archived: TBD

## Details
### Problem Statement
Currently, the project lacks a dedicated public-facing website to showcase its vision, goals, and progress. While the README provides comprehensive information, a well-designed website would make the project more accessible and engaging for potential users and contributors.

### Proposed Solution
Develop a Next.js-based website that initially runs locally for development purposes. The website features:

- Modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Homepage featuring:
  - Hero section with project overview and vision
  - Feature cards highlighting key capabilities
  - Call-to-action sections
  - Core principles
  - Key features of JARVIS
  - Focus on accessibility and inclusion
  - Development philosophy
- Clean, intuitive navigation
- Sections mirroring the documentation structure

### Success Criteria
- [x] Website successfully runs in local development environment
- [x] Homepage effectively communicates project vision and core principles
- [x] Responsive design works across different screen sizes
- [x] Documentation structure is clearly represented
- [x] Modern UI/UX principles are implemented
- [x] Development setup documentation is clear and complete

## Implementation
### Technical Requirements
- Next.js 14+ for frontend development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Responsive design implementation
- Local development environment setup
- Clear documentation for running the website locally

### Dependencies
- Node.js
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Development tools (ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS)

### Components Implemented
- Hero section (`Hero.tsx`)
- Feature cards (`FeatureCard.tsx`)
- Call-to-action sections (`CTA.tsx`)
- Layout components
- Theme configuration

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Design inconsistency | Poor user experience | ✓ Implemented theme system and component guidelines |
| Content maintenance | Outdated information | ✓ Established documentation structure with clear update processes |
| Development environment issues | Difficulty in local testing | ✓ Provided detailed setup in README and component guidelines |

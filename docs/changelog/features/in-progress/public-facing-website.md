# Feature: Public-Facing Website

## Overview
Create a simple, modern public-facing website using React to showcase the JARVIS project, its vision, and core principles. The initial implementation will focus on a local development environment to allow developers to preview and contribute to the website.

## Status
Current status: In Progress
Target Release: 1.0.0

### State Changes
- Proposed: 2025-02-08
- Approved: 2025-02-08
- Started: 2025-02-08
- Completed/Archived: TBD

## Details
### Problem Statement
Currently, the project lacks a dedicated public-facing website to showcase its vision, goals, and progress. While the README provides comprehensive information, a well-designed website would make the project more accessible and engaging for potential users and contributors.

### Proposed Solution
Develop a React-based website that initially runs locally for development purposes. The website will feature:

- Modern, responsive design
- Homepage featuring:
  - Project overview and vision
  - Core principles
  - Key features of JARVIS
  - Focus on accessibility and inclusion
  - Development philosophy
- Clean, intuitive navigation
- Sections mirroring the documentation structure

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Website successfully runs in local development environment
- [ ] Homepage effectively communicates project vision and core principles
- [ ] Responsive design works across different screen sizes
- [ ] Documentation structure is clearly represented
- [ ] Modern UI/UX principles are implemented
- [ ] Development setup documentation is clear and complete

## Implementation
### Technical Requirements
- React.js for frontend development
- Modern UI component library (e.g., Material-UI or Chakra UI)
- Responsive design implementation
- Local development environment setup
- Clear documentation for running the website locally

### Dependencies
- Node.js
- React.js
- UI component library (to be determined)
- Development tools (ESLint, Prettier)

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Design inconsistency | Poor user experience | Establish design system and component library early |
| Content maintenance | Outdated information | Implement content management strategy |
| Development environment issues | Difficulty in local testing | Provide detailed setup documentation |

## Notes
- Initial focus is on local development to enable quick iteration and feedback
- Production deployment infrastructure will be addressed in a future feature
- Design should emphasize accessibility and inclusion
- Consider implementing a blog or news section for project updates in future iterations
